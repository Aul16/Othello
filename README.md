# Othello

Project created during the Coding Week at CentraleSupelec.  

## Game Concept

### Rules

Othello is a game similar to Go: the objective is to control the most territory by capturing the opponent's pieces.  
The Othello rules were taken from the website [www.eothello.com](www.eothello.com).  
You can also try the game on this website.  

### Our Othello Version

This repository contains several components:  
- A `gameOthello` folder containing the game. Simply download this folder to play.  
- A `server` folder containing everything needed to create an online game server.  
- A `tests` folder containing Python test files to verify the correct functioning of the game.  
- An `htmlcov` folder containing the test coverage reports.  

Our game offers several features:  
- Play against an AI with adjustable difficulty  
- Play locally with 2, 3, or 4 players  
- Play online  
- Play a two-player Blitz mode with a time limit  

All these game modes are accessible from the main menu.  

Additionally, in local games, it is possible to undo moves.  

### Unit Tests

Each test file is named according to the Python file it tests.  
All test results can be found in the `htmlcov` folder by opening `index.html`.  
Only the `main.py` file is not tested, as it simply checks the installed libraries and launches the game.  

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Pillow library (`pip install pillow` or `pip3 install pillow`)  

### Playing Locally

Download the `gameOthello` folder and run `main.py` with Python.  

### Playing Online

Click the "Join Game" button to create or join a game.  
The game name is randomly generated by default, but you can choose a custom name.  
To join an existing game, enter the code of a non-started session.  

By default, the game connects to `localhost`, so you need to run `server.py` on the same machine.  
However, you can change the server IP in `network.py` to connect to an external server that you are hosting.  

### Hosting Your Own Server

Download the `server` folder and run `server.py` on your server.  
By default, the client connects on port `5555`. If you want to use a different port,  
you need to update it in `network.py` on the client-side.  

Additionally, update the default IP in the `Network` class so that it connects to your server.  

To play over an external network, open port `5555` on your router and forward it to the server machine.
